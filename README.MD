# Machine Learning and AI Repository
Welcome to the Machine Learning and AI Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing various machine learning projects designed for educational purposes. My goal is to provide practical examples and demonstrations of different techniques and algorithms used in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Projects
### Self-Driving Car
The Self-Driving Car project is the first featured project in this repository. It demonstrates the application of deep Q-learning to navigate a car from the upper left-hand corner of a grid to the lower right-hand corner. The project utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to make intelligent decisions and learn an optimal path.

To run the Self-Driving Car project, please refer to the project's documentation and follow the provided instructions.

### Future Projects
I am continuously working on expanding this repository with new and exciting machine learning projects. Stay tuned for upcoming projects covering a wide range of topics such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.

## Feedback and Collaboration
I value your feedback and contributions to this repository. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or improvements for the existing projects or would like to collaborate on future projects, please feel free to reach out to me at sawanpatel2508@gmail.com.
